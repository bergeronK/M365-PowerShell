The BatchAnalysis-generic.xlsm spreadsheet is designed to be an extension of the Find-MailboxDelegates script at https://aka.ms/find-mailboxdelegates on GitHub. 

If you get a secuirty banner on the spreadsheet that the Macros are blocked, open the file properties in Windows Explorer and 'unblock' the file. 

There is a blog at https://aka.ms/permissions-analysis titled "Who is linked to whom in your spider web of mailbox permissions. Migration batch permissions analysis." that outlines using the script output with the spreadsheet.
